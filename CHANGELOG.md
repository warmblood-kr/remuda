# Changelog

## Unreleased

- Nightly installs and upgrades now use immutable, versioned releases selected
  by `latest.json`; the newest ten are retained. Older installer copies still
  use the rolling `nightly` URL and may see a brief 404 while that compatibility
  release is replaced.
- Nightly builds are not published for ARM Linux (`aarch64-linux`) or Intel
  macOS (`x86_64-apple-darwin`); those platforms must build from source.
- Lua: `remuda.hostname()` returns the OS host name from the OS itself (not the
  environment), or `nil, error` if it is empty, not UTF-8, or holds a control,
  line-separator or bidi-control character. It is not sanitized for
  identifiers; callers slug it.
- On Windows the data directory moved from `%USERPROFILE%\.local\share` to
  `%LOCALAPPDATA%`: the channel file (`%LOCALAPPDATA%\remuda\channel`), mods
  (`%LOCALAPPDATA%\remuda\mods`) and the update-check cache
  (`%LOCALAPPDATA%\remuda\cache`). `XDG_DATA_HOME` and `XDG_CACHE_HOME` still
  win. Nothing is migrated.
